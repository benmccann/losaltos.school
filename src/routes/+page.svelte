			<h2>
				PETITION TO THE CITY MANAGER
				<br />
				AND CITY COUNCIL OF LOS ALTOS
			</h2>
		</div>

		<div class="letter-content">
			<p>
				<span>
					We were surprised to learn that the City of Los Altos is planning to end the Tiny Tots and
					Kinder Prep Preschool programs and open up an RFP for corporations to bid on using the
					preschool facilities.
				</span>
			</p>

			<p>
				<span>
					The Tiny Tots program has been in existence for 50+ years, with many former students now
					sending their own children to participate. The program also sets the children up to become
					engaged citizens through the unique opportunities they have to interact with other
					community organizations through regular field trips and activities. A quality preschool
					program with a low student/teacher ratio and an affordable price has countless benefits
					for not only students, but the community as a whole. High quality early education programs
					attract residents and prepare students for success in Los Altos schools.
				</span>
			</p>

			<p>
				<span>
					The program consists of experienced teachers with a passion for early childhood
					development in an environment that allows the children to learn and thrive. The staff has
					gone above and beyond to provide a quality experience, even through the trying times of
					the COVID pandemic. It is disturbing that the city is contemplating a loss of these
					teaching jobs during a nationwide teacher shortage. The proposed implementation timeline
					means there is a high risk that no program will be offered next year as it will be
					extremely challenging to contract with a private company, hire new teachers, and enroll
					students in time for next school year.
				</span>
			</p>

			<p>
				<span>
					It is alarming that the city is planning to eliminate this long standing program without
					providing parents or the community any notice or transparency into the decision making
					process. Tax dollars should be going to benefit the local community, rather than a private
					corporation. Outsourcing to a private company will result in a decrease in program
					quality, an increase in tuition, and the loss of highly experienced and dedicated
					teachers. We are urging the city to delay their decision and first attempt working with
					the community to make the Tiny Tots and Kinder Prep programs successful. The parents of
					the school are highly engaged in the school and community and are asking to have the
					chance to work together on potential solutions before a decision to shutter our local
					school is made without consultation of parents, students, teachers, and residents.
