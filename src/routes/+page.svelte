		<h1>BACKGROUND</h1>

		<div class="background-content">
			The city of Los Altos has been running the <a
				href="https://www.losaltosca.gov/parksrec/page/tiny-tots">Tiny Tots</a
			>
			preschool program for over fifty years. The program consists of
			<a href="https://www.losaltosca.gov/parksrec/page/playschool-age-3-4"
				>Playschool for 3-4 year olds</a
			>
			and
			<a href="https://www.losaltosca.gov/parksrec/page/kinder-prep-4s-age-4-5"

			<h1>LETTER</h1>

			<h2>
				PETITION TO THE CITY MANAGER
				<br />
				AND CITY COUNCIL OF LOS ALTOS
			</h2>
		</div>

		<div class="letter-content">
			<p>
				<span>
					WE, the undersigned, were surprised to learn that the City of Los Altos is planning to end
					the Tiny Tots Preschool program and open up an RFP for corporations to bid on using the
					preschool facilities. It is alarming that the city is planning to eliminate this
					long-standing program without providing parents or the community notice, transparency into
					the decision making process, and a chance to address any concerns.
				</span>
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				<span>
					THAT, the Tiny Tots program has been in existence for 50+ years, many former students are
					now sending their own children to participate. The program sets children up to become
					engaged citizens through the unique opportunities they have to interact with other
					community organizations through regular field trips and activities. A quality preschool
					program with a low student to teacher ratio and an affordable price has countless benefits
					for not only students, but the community as a whole. High quality early education programs
					attract residents and prepare students for success in Los Altos schools.
				</span>
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				<span>
					THAT, the program consists of experienced teachers with a passion for early childhood
					development, the school provides an environment which allows the children to learn and
					thrive. The staff has gone above and beyond to provide a quality experience, even through
					the trying times of the COVID pandemic. It is disturbing that the city is contemplating
					laying off highly qualified teachers during a nationwide teacher shortage. The proposed
					implementation timeline means there is a high risk that no program will be offered next
					year as it will be extremely challenging to contract with a private company, hire new
					teachers, and enroll students in time for next school year.
				</span>
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				<span>
					THAT, the benefits of tax dollars should be going to the local community, rather than a
					private corporation. Outsourcing to a private company will result in a decrease in program
					quality, an increase in tuition, and the loss of highly experienced and dedicated
					teachers.
				</span>
			</p>

			<br />
			<p>
				<span>
					OUR REQUEST, is that the city to delay their decision and first attempt working with the
					parents and community to continue the long successful legacy of the Tiny Tots and Kinder
					Prep programs. A collaborative solutioning process should be fully attempted before a
					decision is made to shutter and privatize our local school without consultation of
					parents, students, teachers, and residents.
				</span>
			</p>

			<br />
			<p>
				<span> THEREFORE, the city should continue the program into the next school year. </span>
			</p>

			<br />
			<p><span>Sincerely Yours,<br />(Signatures are attached)</span></p>
