				The city of Los Altos has been running its <a
					href="https://www.losaltosca.gov/parksrec/page/tiny-tots">Tiny Tots</a
				>
				preschool program for over fifty years. The program consists of
				<a href="https://www.losaltosca.gov/parksrec/page/playschool-age-3-4"
					>Playschool for 3-4 year olds</a
				>
				and
				<a href="https://www.losaltosca.gov/parksrec/page/kinder-prep-4s-age-4-5"
					>Kinder Prep for 4-5 year olds.</a
				>
			</p>
			<p>
				The Tiny Tots program currently costs residents about $4,000/yr for 5 day/week attendance
				compared to roughly $15,000/yr for comparable programs run by Children's House and
				Children's Corner, which have expressed interest in taking over the program. <a
					href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1L5aSYyT9czOeibSTfbyEBWTpGqiz6us0?usp=drive_link"
					>The program's financials</a
				> show a 55% increase in revenue would be necessary for the program to break even in 2023. Increasing
				tuition for the first time in over a decade would allow the program to remain available at less
				than half the cost of comparable programs and would be in the best interest of the community.

			<h1>LETTER</h1>

			<h2>
				PETITION TO THE CITY MANAGER
				<br />
				AND CITY COUNCIL OF LOS ALTOS
			</h2>
		</div>

		<div class="letter-content">
			<p>
				<span>
					WE, the undersigned, were surprised to learn that the City of Los Altos is planning to end
					its preschool program and open up an RFP for corporations to bid on using the preschool
					facilities. It is alarming that the city is planning to eliminate this long-standing
					program without providing parents or the community notice, transparency into the decision
					making process, and a chance to address any concerns.
				</span>
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				<span>
					THAT, the Tiny Tots preschool program has been in existence for 50+ years, many former
					students are now sending their own children to participate. The program sets children up
					to become engaged citizens through the unique opportunities they have to interact with
					other community organizations through regular field trips and activities. A quality
					preschool program with a low student to teacher ratio and an affordable price has
					countless benefits for not only students, but the community as a whole. High quality early
					education programs attract residents and prepare students for success in Los Altos
					schools.
				</span>
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				<span>
					THAT, the program consists of experienced teachers with a passion for early childhood
					development, the school provides an environment which allows the children to learn and
					thrive. The staff has gone above and beyond to provide a quality experience, even through
					the trying times of the COVID pandemic. It is disturbing that the city is contemplating
					laying off highly qualified teachers during a nationwide teacher shortage. The proposed
					implementation timeline means there is a high risk that no program will be offered next
					year as it will be extremely challenging to contract with a private company, hire new
					teachers, and enroll students in time for next school year.
				</span>
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				<span>
					THAT, outsourcing to a private company will result in a decrease in program quality, an
					increase in tuition, and the loss of highly experienced and dedicated teachers. The city
					can alter the economics of the program without introducing a middleman that will extract
					funds for its own profit. The addition of profit-driven middlemen will only serve to
					worsen the experience for students, parents, and teachers at the school.
				</span>
			</p>

			<br />
			<p>
				<span>
					OUR REQUEST is that the city delay their decision and first attempt working with the
					parents and community to continue the long successful legacy of the Tiny Tots and Kinder
					Prep programs. A collaborative solutioning process should be fully attempted before a
					decision is made to shutter and privatize our local school without consultation of
					parents, students, teachers, and residents.
				</span>
			</p>

			<br />
			<p>
				<span> THEREFORE, the city should continue the program into the next school year. </span>
			</p>

			<br />
			<p><span>Sincerely Yours,<br />(Signatures are attached)</span></p>
